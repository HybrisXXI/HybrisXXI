👋 Hi, I’m @Hybris 

👀 I’m interested in AI as a lever for progress, combinations of tech systems, and building things that outlast hype—code, frameworks, or literal shelves. I’ve got lots of creative ideas and concepts in mind, but I’m sadly lacking resources to realize them. So relying on cloud solutions until I get a decent workstation.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to bend exponential trends into tools, decentralized architectures, and right now I’m into off-label cursor experiments.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI experiments, open-source tools for democratized innovation, or anything that breaks "how it’s always been done". If you need an outsider’s perspective, feel free to ask; I can’t help solve programming issues, but I understand architectures and concepts well and think in pragmatic, interdisciplinary ways.

📫 How to reach me: GitHub issues or X—I’m a coding noob, so keep it semantic.

⚡ Fun fact: I assemble DIY tech from scrap but still need Google to exit Vim.
